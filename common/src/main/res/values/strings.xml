Enabling the \"Add New Intent\" toggle will create 1 setting to allow you to register for a broadcast intent. The toggle will switch back to off once a new setting is created so you will need to turn it back on to save more intents. You can also clear out the setting value to remove the setting in the next update. You must restart the application after making changes to these settings to take effect.</string>
